            <br> </br>
            <p>
            My name is Pranav and I am a high school student who is passionate about computers, engineering, and technology. 
            I have experience designing and creating projects and collaborating with others. 
            In my free time, I enjoy recommending, refurbishing tech, tinkering with Mindstorms, and taking up other fun projects. 
            I am particularly interested in electrical and computer engineering and plan to pursue a career in this field. 
            I am dedicated to endurance cycling and fitness, always looking for new challenges and ways to stay active.
